# Amazon Scraper R 

A simple loop that dinamically fetches the URL of the pages with the reviews comments and extract the consequentially selector for the Reviews Title, Text, Stars and Page number, removes the white space (left and right) and trim the Stars text leaving only the number.

The complete data frame then generates a xlsx file ready to be used.
